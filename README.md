# Card-flip-game

This is a small game build for my son. 
Everytime we pass by MRT Zhongxiao Fuxing Station, there's a moniter where we can play a card flip game. 
Inspired by that, I created a similar one and with more options to add more cards or shorten memory seconds. 
Hope you will also enjoy the game.
